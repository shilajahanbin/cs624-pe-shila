Programming Exercises for CS624 - Spring 2025

# Input
This program does not require any user input. Once the application launches, the content is displayed immediately without any interaction. There are no buttons, forms, or input fields involved in the interface. The sole function of the application is to present pre-defined static information to the user upon opening the app.

# Process
The app was developed using React Native with the Expo framework. When the app is executed, the main file (`App.js`) runs and returns a single `View` container, which includes three `Text` components. The layout is controlled using a `StyleSheet` object that defines the appearance and positioning of each element. The container fills the screen with a yellow background and centers the text both vertically and horizontally. The development process involved using the `create-expo-app` CLI with a blank template and editing the `App.js` file directly.

# Output
The output is a visually simple screen that displays three lines of text centered on a yellow background:
- Shila Jahanbin
- MS in Computer Science
- City University of Seattle
This output is consistent and remains static.
