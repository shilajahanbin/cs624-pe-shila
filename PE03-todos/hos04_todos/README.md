Input

This simple to-do app starts with a text box where users can type what they need to get done. After typing, they tap the Submit button to add the task to their list. Each task appears with options to mark it as done or delete it if it’s no longer needed.

Process

When a task is added, the app stores it along with a unique number and marks it as “not done” by default. Users can switch a task’s status by tapping “Done,” or remove it entirely. At the bottom of the screen, three tabs – All, Active, and Complete – let users filter their tasks based on what they want to see. The app updates automatically when the filter changes.

Output

The result is a clean, easy-to-read list of tasks. Whether you’re looking at all your tasks, just the ones still in progress, or only the completed ones, the app makes it easy to stay organized.
