# Input

The assignment started with a basic profile card layout created in the previous task (HOS05). The input included a card structure with a profile image and background color. For this task (PE04 Part 1), I needed to add my name, occupation, and a short description to complete the card visually and semantically.

# Process

I used React Native components such as `View`, `Image`, and `Text` to build the layout. I applied styles using `StyleSheet.create()` and organized spacing, colors, alignment, and font sizes. My name was styled in white to stand out against the background, while my occupation and description were styled in black for contrast. I also added underlining to the job title and used justified alignment and horizontal margins for a clean look. The image is centered inside a circular white container.

# Output

The result is a clean, styled profile card showing a picture, name, job title, and description—well-aligned, readable, and matching the assignment’s design sample.
